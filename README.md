# Scole's ECMA-262 in Python project

Look, this isn't really for public consumption.

But: I've always thought the ECMA-262 spec was a fascinating thing,
and I've always dreamed of building an implementation from it. (Not expecting, ever, to
approach Google's V8, or anybody else's implementation for that matter.)

It stayed in my brain for decades, and recently I decided to try and actually do that implementation,
as a Python project.

So here we are.

The repo on GitHub is really just a place to stash my work in progress. Also a place to test out
SaaS build tools, as I can wrangle some of them to run my tests.

Is this something you want to clone? Probably not.

And I'll probably ignore anybody's reported issues.

This is just for me and my coding itch. (I suppose that's the curse of becoming a manager: I don't code nearly as much as I used to.)
